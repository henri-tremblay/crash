This chapter provides various recipes using the attach mechanism of CRaSH.

== Expose several already running JVM via SSH using

In this recipe you will learn how to attach CRaSH to several JVM running on the local host. Each JVM will
be accessible using the SSH connector. To achieve this goal we need to

* attach CRaSH to one or several virtual machines
* use the non-interactive mode
* set the SSH port to 0 to avoid port collisions

----
crash.sh --non-interactive --property crash.ssh.port=0 PID1 PID2 PID3 ...
----

The execution of CRaSH will last a few seconds, the process will end when all JVM will have their own agent.
