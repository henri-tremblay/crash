The mail plugin configures an email client for CRaSH. This email client can be used as a service or via the +mail+
command.

== Deployment

The plugin consist of two jars:

* the JavaMail jar +mail-1.4.jar+
* the plugin jar +crash.plugins.mail-{crash-version}.jar+

when the two jars are present in the classpath of CRaSH, they will be detected and the plugin will be present.

== Configuration

Configuration is done with CRaSH properties:

.Configuring an SMTP server for the CRaSH plugin
[subs="attributes,specialcharacters", options="nowrap"]
----
crash.mail.smtp.host=smtp.gmail.com
crash.mail.smtp.port=587
crash.mail.smtp.secure=tls
crash.mail.smtp.username=admin
crash.mail.smtp.password=admin
crash.mail.smtp.from=admin@mydomain.org
crash.mail.debug=false
----

The configuration is pretty obvious and follow the usual JavaMail configuration properties.

== Mail command

The mail command can be used to send emails. The command consumes a stream of objects and render them
to text before sending the email.
