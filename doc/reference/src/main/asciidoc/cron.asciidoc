http://www.sauronsoftware.it/projects/cron4j/[cron4j] library.

== Deployment

The plugin consist of two jars:

* the cron4j jar +cron4j-2.2.5.jar+
* the plugin jar +crash.plugins.cron-{crash-version}.jar+

when the two jars are present in the classpath of CRaSH, they will be detected and the plugin will be present.

other crontab configuration file it consists of two parts:

* a scheduling pattern, for instance +* * * * *+, this is http://www.sauronsoftware.it/projects/cron4j/manual.php#p02[documented] in the cron4j library
